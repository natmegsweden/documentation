## Psychophysiology

For psychophysiology measurements beyond ECG and EOG we use  an MP150 system from BioPac. In the current setup, we have modules for measurements of ECG, GSR, respiration and blood oxygenation.

BioPac output is typically recorded via BioPac's AcqKnowledge software, but is also output into the MEG system analog channels and sampled side by side with the MEG data.
