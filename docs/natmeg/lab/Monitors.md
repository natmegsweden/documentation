# Monitors

## Dual monitors
You can use dual monitors on the Stimulation PC if you want to run Presentation separate from the screen shown to the participant in the MSR, for example, if you are going to show a video to the participant instead of the Presentation screen.

1. On the Stimulation PC, right-click on the Windows desktop and select Screen Settings.
2. Change the so that the screens are extended. Confirm changes.
3. On the second screen (the one connected to the eye tracker), switch input to DVI.

Presentation will still as a default run on the first monitor. Change the monitor by changing your Presentation project settings. Under the menu "Monitors" you change the driver from "Standard Driver" to the one with a number.

## After measurement
Remember to switch the screens back to the standard setting when you are done.
